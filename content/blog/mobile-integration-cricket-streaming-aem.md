In the digital era, enterprises strive to deliver seamless web-to-mobile experiences. We walk you through a case study of a client seeking to migrate their React-based web application to a mobile platform, with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) as their backend system. This concise guide will present four distinctive strategies, analyzing their benefits and costs, to inform your decision-making process.

## Breaking Down Your Mobile Integration Options

Here are the four primary strategies explored:

**AEM + React:** This is the simplest, least expensive route, relying on React's responsive design capabilities to create a mobile-friendly web application. However, it might not offer the native mobile functionalities other options provide.

**AEM + React + Native (Android/iOS/WindowsMobile):** The highest performing and most customizable option that leverages native frameworks for each platform, leading to a seamless user experience. However, this involves greater development effort and costs.

**AEM + React + ReactNative:** A cross-platform strategy with code reusability across multiple platforms, providing native device features access. While versatile, it may need some platform-specific code adjustments for a fully native experience.

**AEM + React + Cordova:** A cost-effective balance of native functionality and web application benefits, offering a good user experience. However, performance may not be as high as fully native options.

## Factors Guiding Your Mobile Integration Strategy

The optimal strategy for your mobile integration depends on several factors, including the requirement for near-native performance, the need for stringent security measures, the desire for a customized user experience, dependency on native device functionalities, offline functionality requirements, and intent to publish on app stores.

## Lessons from Thailand: The React + Cordova Experience

In our case study, a cost-effective, efficient development strategy was adopted in Thailand using React + Cordova. Despite the performance and customization limitations compared to fully native options, React + Cordova offered cost-effectiveness, cross-platform compatibility, and access to native functionalities via plugins.

### Estimating the Cost of Mobile Integration Strategies

The cost, ranging from cheapest to most expensive, for the different strategies are:

**React:** Most cost-effective, lacking additional framework costs but with limited native functionality.

**React + Cordova:** Balance between cost and native functionality, with some device compatibility maintenance costs.

**React + ReactNative:** More expensive due to possible platform-specific customization costs, despite code reusability.

**React + Native (Android/iOS/WindowsMobile):** Most expensive due to separate native development for each platform, offering full native functionality.

## Client Recommendation

Given the client's requirements and budget, we recommend the AEM + React + Cordova strategy for its cost-effectiveness, cross-platform compatibility, and access to native features. Nonetheless, it is crucial for the client to evaluate their priorities and the associated trade-offs with each option.

## Conclusion

Through this guide, we've discussed four potential mobile integration strategies and provided a recommendation based on various factors. Ultimately, the decision lies with the client, who needs to assess their specific requirements, budget, and the trade-offs involved.

## Further Reading for CXOs

For a holistic understanding of some terminologies used:

**Cordova**: Cordova is an open-source mobile development framework that allows developers to create mobile apps using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With Cordova, you can write a single app that runs on multiple mobile operating systems, reducing development time and costs.

**AEM (Adobe Experience Manager)**: AEM is a comprehensive content management solution for building websites, mobile apps, and forms, making it easier to manage marketing content and assets.
